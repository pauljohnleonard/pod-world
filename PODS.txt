1. Pod state data
=================

 This contains information about the pod.

 If you have a pod then pod.state.x is it's s position
 
 The controller in the plugin has a parameter which is the current
 state of the pod 
 

 ef controller(sensors,state,control):   
      ... your code   
 
 See 00_main.py for example of printing the state data.
 
--  position from top left of screen (in pixels):
y 
x

-- rate of change of x and y  and the velocity (to make life easy for you)
dydt 
dxdt 
vel 


-- angle of pod from in radians anti-clockwise ?
-- 0 is pointing down    up is PI   
ang        can be greater than 2pi (so it wraps around)
dangdt     rate of change of angle (spin)

-- progress in terms of trip wires crossed
pos_trips
neg_trips

   after collision with the side further information about progress  (0-1 measures progress from porevious to next trip)
seg_pos 0.4

--- Other stuff 
distance_travelled     (forward and backward) 
age     
collide_count  (number of time we have hit a wall)
collide True/False
slip    (0-1   1 means slipping a lot) 


2. Sensors
==========

Can be placed at a given angle in radians anti-clockwise form direction of travel (pointy bit)

See simple/plugin.py

Sensors will tell you the distance to a wall.

3. Control
==========

 A  control object has 4 fields which can be assign values between 0 and 1.

up      thrust
down    brake
left    as on the can
right   ditto
