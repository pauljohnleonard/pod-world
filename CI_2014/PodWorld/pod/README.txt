Pod world frame work.
=====================

See example code for usage.

Not intended for viewing by students.

The code is the result of an evolution which made it too complex for use by students followed by a simplification.
The result is many modules contain unused/redundant code which is likely to confuse the weak minded.

Please discuss any suspect behaviour with Dr PJ.
